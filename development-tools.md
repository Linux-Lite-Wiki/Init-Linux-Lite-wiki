To check:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Install pip and virtual environments:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

#### Java

Install OpenJDK:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```

Check version:

```bash
java -version
```

Set environment variables:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

#### Node.js & npm

Install Node.js and npm:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Check versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

For newer versions, consider using Node Version Manager (nvm).

#### C/C++

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

Basic commands:

```bash
git init                   # Initialize repo
git clone <url>            # Clone repo
git add .                  # Stage changes
git commit -m "Message"    # Commit changes
git push                   # Push to remote
```

To generate an SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
