### 3.1 First Boot

#### Welcome Screen Overview

When you boot into Linux Lite for the first time, you will be greeted by the **Lite Welcome** screen. This introductory utility is designed to guide new users through essential post-installation steps.

The welcome screen typically includes shortcuts to:

* Install system updates
* Install drivers
* Set system restore points (via Timeshift)
* Access documentation and support
* Install additional software
* Adjust system settings

You can choose to have this screen launch at every startup or disable it after your initial configuration is complete.

#### Update System Using Lite Welcome

One of the most important steps after installation is updating your system. On the Lite Welcome screen, click the “Install Updates” button.

This will:

* Fetch the latest security patches
* Update the kernel and installed software
* Improve overall stability

You may be prompted to enter your password during this process. It is advisable to restart your system after a major update, especially if a kernel or driver package was upgraded.

#### Language and Time Settings

If you did not configure these during installation or wish to make changes:

* Open **Menu > Settings > Language Support** to install or modify system languages.
* Open **Menu > Settings > Time and Date** to set or synchronize your local time zone.

You can also enable automatic time synchronization using the Internet time servers.

### 3.2 Initial Setup Guide

After updating your system and adjusting time settings, follow this basic checklist to complete your setup.

#### Update System

In case you skipped updates during the welcome screen, you can still update your system using:

* **Lite Update** tool (graphical interface)
* Or run in terminal:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```

#### Install Drivers

Linux Lite includes a utility for installing proprietary and third-party drivers.

Steps:

1. Go to **Menu > Settings > Install Drivers**
2. The system will search for available drivers (such as NVIDIA, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
3. Select and install the recommended drivers
4. Reboot if prompted

This tool is particularly helpful for installing proprietary graphics drivers or wireless adapters that require additional firmware.

#### Install Additional Software

Use the **Lite Software** tool to install commonly used applications in one click.

Steps:

1. Open **Menu > System > Lite Software**
2. Browse the list of available applications such as:

   * Google Chrome
   * VLC Media Player
   * GIMP
   * VirtualBox
3. Select and install any tools you want

Alternatively, you can use **Synaptic Package Manager** or the terminal to install software via the `apt` command.

### 3.3 User Interface Tour

#### XFCE Desktop Overview

Linux Lite uses the XFCE desktop environment, chosen for its balance of performance and flexibility. It provides a traditional desktop metaphor with a panel at the bottom and icons on the desktop.

The default desktop includes:

* **Main panel (bottom)** with a start menu, quick launch icons, task switcher, and system tray
* **Desktop icons** for shortcuts like file manager and system monitor
* **Right-click desktop menu** for quick access to settings and applications

#### Menu Structure

The **Menu** button (similar to the Start Menu in Windows) is located on the bottom-left corner. It is organized into categories such as:

* Accessories
* Graphics
* Internet
* Multimedia
* Office
* Settings
* System

You can pin frequently used applications to the panel or desktop for quicker access.

#### System Tray and Notifications

The **system tray** is on the bottom-right of the panel and includes:

* Volume control
* Battery status (on laptops)
* Network manager
* Clipboard manager
* Notification area
* Clock

Notifications will appear in the upper-right corner of the screen and include alerts about updates, new devices, or system messages.

#### Workspaces

Workspaces allow you to have multiple virtual desktops. This is useful for organizing open applications and multitasking.

* By default, XFCE provides multiple workspaces accessible via keyboard shortcuts or workspace switcher.
* You can switch workspaces using:

  * Mouse scroll on the desktop
  * `Ctrl + Alt + arrow key`
  * The workspace switcher on the panel (if enabled)

Workspaces can be customized under **Settings > Workspaces** to adjust the number of desktops or names.
