## 7. System Maintenance

Maintaining a Linux Lite system is simple and requires minimal technical knowledge. With built-in tools and regular upkeep, users can ensure their system remains secure, fast, and reliable over time.

### 7.1 System Updates

Regular system updates are critical to maintaining the security, stability, and performance of your Linux Lite installation. Linux Lite offers both graphical and command-line methods for keeping your system up to date.

#### GUI Method: Lite Update

Linux Lite includes **Lite Update**, a graphical tool that simplifies the process of checking for and applying system updates.

To use Lite Update:

1. Go to **Menu > System > Lite Update**
2. Enter your password when prompted
3. Click **Begin Update**
4. Review and confirm the list of packages to be updated
5. Wait for the updates to complete

Lite Update automates both package list refresh and upgrade steps, providing a one-click solution for most users.

#### Terminal Method

For users who prefer the terminal, updates can be performed using `apt`, the Advanced Package Tool.

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

1. Refresh the package index:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Apply all available upgrades:

   ```bash
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

3. Optionally, upgrade all packages and remove obsolete dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo apt full-upgrade
   sudo apt autoremove
   ```

Using the terminal provides more granular control and is ideal for advanced users or remote management.

### 7.2 Cleaning & Optimization

Over time, your system may accumulate unused packages, cached files, and temporary data that can slow down performance or consume disk space. Linux Lite provides tools to clean and optimize your system safely.

#### Lite Tweaks Features

**Lite Tweaks** is a custom maintenance tool that provides one-click access to several cleanup and optimization routines.

To open:

* Go to **Menu > System > Lite Tweaks**

Available options include:

* Clear package and thumbnail cache
* Remove orphaned packages
* Clean memory logs
* Purge old kernels (safe and automated)
* Disable hibernation (frees swap space on SSDs)
* Repair broken application menu entries
* Reset network or firewall settings

Each option is clearly described and includes warnings before applying any potentially disruptive changes.

#### Autoremove & Autoclean (Terminal)

Linux Lite inherits Debian's `apt` tools for managing system cleanup.

To remove unnecessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

To clear local repository of downloaded .deb files:

```bash
sudo apt autoclean
```

To remove all cached .deb files (even for current packages):

```bash
sudo apt clean
```

Running these commands regularly helps conserve disk space and reduce clutter from outdated software.

#### Disk Usage Analyzer

The **Disk Usage Analyzer** is a graphical tool that provides a visual overview of how disk space is being used across directories.

To access:

* Go to **Menu > Accessories > Disk Usage Analyzer**

You can scan the file system or individual folders to identify large files, unused applications, or cache directories that can be cleaned manually.

### 7.3 Backups

Regular backups are essential for protecting your data and system configuration. Linux Lite includes **Timeshift**, a dedicated snapshot tool designed to simplify system backups.

#### Timeshift Setup and Use

To open Timeshift:

* Go to **Menu > System > Timeshift**

Initial setup steps:

1. Choose snapshot type (RSYNC is recommended)
2. Select the target device for backups
3. Define snapshot retention levels (daily, weekly, monthly)
4. Start creating your first snapshot

Snapshots include the operating system, settings, and installed applicationsâ€”but not personal files unless explicitly configured.

#### Schedule and Restore Points

Timeshift supports automatic snapshot scheduling. This ensures that your system is backed up regularly without requiring manual intervention.

Available schedules:

* Hourly
* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly
* At boot

Restoring a snapshot:

1. Launch Timeshift
2. Select a snapshot from the list
3. Click **Restore** and follow the on-screen instructions

The system will reboot and revert to the selected snapshot, allowing you to recover from system failure, configuration errors, or software conflicts.

It is recommended to store backups on a separate partition or external drive for maximum reliability.
